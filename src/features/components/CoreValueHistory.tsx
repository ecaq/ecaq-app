                  PCEC continually defines and defends its evangelical heritage
                  through solid, historical and biblical scholarship, and
                  creative reflection, being aware of contemporary challenges to
                  the faith. It attracts all groups that share the same
                  evangelical distinctives but also nurtures dialogue and
                  creative cooperation with other Christian bodies.

                  The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC) was
                  established in 1965 by a group of Christian leaders seeking to
                  form an organization that would express their oneness in Jesus
                  Christ and to formalize into a distinct council the growing
                  force and influence of evangelism in the country. The defense
                  of the fundamentals of faith, the need to evangelize the
                  Philippines, and the need to have a clearly evangelical
                  witness were the primary factors that prompted PCEC’s
                  inception.
